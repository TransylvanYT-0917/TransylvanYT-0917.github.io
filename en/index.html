        <h2>
            Creating site
        </h2>
        <p>
            This site was created in the third birthday of YouTube-channel (I mean October 21st, 2023), 
                with the nickname "TransylvanYT".
            I develop faster how I can, but with New Year's coming I did it really slow!
            Later I had an idea to customize site, but also later - make it a site for HTML lessons.
            Be honestly, site was turned to YouTube-channel TransylvanYT again.
        </p>

        <h2>
            History of the main channel (#0917)
        </h2>
        <p>
            At October 21st, 2021 was created "Вiлiкая Трансiльванiя"
            (P. S.: I forgot, what really language was it).
            I hosted there wars with different countries with only 1 computerЪ and chocolate :).
            But later delete them for no popularity.
            I didn't know what to do a long time. But in January, 2023...
            I was watching the shorts, as seen TravelBoast shorts-trend about historical territories.
            This trend I was recording until 2024 year. A late? Anyways,
            @ArtemNaruto is coming in this cool history. Anyways, he's a little bit dumb 
                (even if he telled me the right way, when I went to delete my own channel).
            Come back to content. Of course, many people was subscribed, but it started be not popularity.
            I went to make mapping videos. Even if I just made a cool content, nobody was rating it.
            Later, in the end of February, a new trend comed to YouTube called "Nights With A Cat" 
                and I started make the videos.
            At March 1st, 2024 a video beginned popularity. To 38K views.
            I was in confused form, because I get 500 subscribers in the first week.
            Later, this number just become a little bit more, and now I have 916 subscribers and ~200K views.

        <h2>
            Develoment of Discord-server
        </h2>
        <p>
            I created my own first server at an August night.
            It was English and was created for chatting with my friends. 
            Later, I lost my account and I had to create a new server
            I made this server also English, but just joined only @☬∈R∋₦♔Ψ∈₳₲∋R☬, 
                which was the only friend in Discord. 
            Once, I called my friend from class Nikita to Discord. 
            Remember that nights when I played Minecraft with him.
            Nostalgic...
            I called him to my Discord-server and we just think what to do and when to do. 
            Later, this server's been hacked, but I made a new one. 
            I conflicted with my friend Nikita so many times.
            And there in the story Artem (@ArtemNaruto) was joined, that wasn't doing right anything.
            Yeah...
